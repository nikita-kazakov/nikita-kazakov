I'm an engineer and I like to build interesting products. I began my career as a Petroleum Engineer, working for [companies that create Oil and Gas Software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitakazakov).

I progressed to product management and [shipped various software](/projects/) to market.

I needed to build and not simply manage. I had to get into the trenches with other software developers.

I made a big move and [switched careers](http://localhost:4000/switching-careers-from-oil-to-software/) from Oil and Gas to software development.

I have zero regrets and I'm loving it. I enjoy software development because I get to solve problems and contribute what feels like real work.

I continue to integrate my previous management experience into the software world by mentoring fellow developers and leading projects to launch.

I [write about lessons I've learned and about technical topics](/posts/) on this blog revolving around software development and general life topics.

My audience is a younger version of myself but I'm glad to see when an idea here helps someone else.
