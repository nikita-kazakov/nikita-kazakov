About a year before my Project Management Professional (PMP) certification is set to expire, I start to work towards the requirements to renew it.

As of 2020, you need to earn and claim 60 PDUs to renew your PMP.

I wrote a post about [making sense of PDUs and different ways you can earn them](https://nikitakazakov.com/how-i-renewed-my-pmp-certification/). One of my favorite ways is to listen to [Project Management Podcasts](https://www.project-management-podcast.com/podcast-episodes/) while I&#8217;m driving to work. They are FREE.

# How to submit your PDUs to PMI

Sign up at [ccrs.pmi.org](https://ccrs.pmi.org)<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

    caption = "You’ll see all the relevant information on the dashboard."

    alt = "You’ll see all the relevant information on the dashboard."
%}

Select the option to report your PDUs. If you&#8217;ve read my previous post on [how to earn PDUs and where to get them from](https://nikitakazakov.com/how-i-renewed-my-pmp-certification/), you probably have been keeping track of all PDUs you&#8217;ve earned in a spreadsheet.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

You don't have to provide a lot of detail in the description box when claiming PDUs. For example, when I submit a podcast that I&#8217;ve listened to, I provide the titles of each podcast episodes and the dates when I listed to them.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

You don't have to submit PDUs individually. I tend to submit them in bulk as you see above with multiple podcast episodes. If you&#8217;re using the same [podcast spreadsheet I&#8217;m using](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zYKe_f7YJYrAoNXTMPf9pQqmx8NsCZqVgkS_SoYPLTI/edit#gid=0) created by Cornelius Fichtner, then you&#8217;ll have an easy time determining which category each podcast episode fulfills.

Claim 60 PDUs and then you&#8217;ll be able to renew your PMP certificate on that same website.
