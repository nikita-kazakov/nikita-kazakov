Bottom Line --- I look at my knuckles often to remind myself that this hard moment --- It too, shall pass.

Make a fist right now and look at the front of it.<figure class="wp-caption">

See those peaks and valleys? They’re wisdom without spoken words. Knuckles are a reminder of flow.

What goes after a peak? A valley.

What goes after a valley? A peak.

It’s as if mother nature gave us a natural reminder of how life will flow. I forget this principle because of life’s distractions.

I’ll get a little sleep and wake up feeling as if I’m running on half my cylinders. There’s a work problem I can’t push through. Meetings pile up. Four friends want to get together during the same week. My mind is all over the place and feels scattered.<figure class="wp-caption">

I look at my knuckles and realize that the next stop is a peak. It’s right around the corner but I can’t see it yet. I can shift my focus from negative to neutral.

Now consider a happy moment. Dopamine is flooding your brain and you’re feeling _like a boss_. You’re on top of the world!

> You got your first gig.  
> You bought your first car.  
> You landed her.  
> You got a salary bump that you’ve been waiting for.  
> You upped that lift by 10 lbs.  
> You lost 30 lbs in weight.<figure class="wp-caption">

I’m super excited when looking at that list! In that moment I forget the feeling will pass. Sorry to be a downer.

**Peaks and valleys are opposite sides of the same coin.**

Knuckles remind me to accept the happy moment and be grateful for its temporary presence.<figure class="wp-caption">

The moment will pass, but will I be able to come down to equilibrium rather than be stuck at high and low extremes?

Knuckles remind me that if I’m feeling low, a high is around the corner. If I’m feeling high, don’t get too used to it as somewhere along the line, a low is inevitable.

Be ready for it when it comes.
