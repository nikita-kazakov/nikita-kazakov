I’m on my way to meet a friend for dinner. It’s a 15 minute drive but I hit traffic — in a parking garage.

The line is 15 cars long and it’s getting longer. **I assume that _someone is working on fixing the problem._**

Ten minutes pass and I see brake lights from several cars ahead of me. **No one is getting out of their car**. I shut the car off and approach the lady at the gate who has been sitting there for a while. She’s blocking all the traffic from exiting.

>   “What’s the problem?” I ask.
    “The machine is asking for $2 and it’s not taking my cash”.
    “Use a credit card”
    “It’s in the back seat and it was hard to reach for it” she says.
    “Use my card, and I’ll take your $2 cash”.

She declines. She reaches in the back to grab her own card.

I get back in my car and the line is still not moving. Once again I approach the lady and she says the machine is not taking her card.<figure>

**No one is getting out of their car.**

I grab the red phone on the side of a wall and it connects me to an operator. I tell him to open the gate. The gate opens and traffic finally escapes the garage.

# Wrong — No one is getting out of the car

If I didn’t get out of the car, I’m pretty sure we’d be waiting forever. Today I learned that taking initiative is not natural.

You assume that everyone around you is hustling and taking action. Wrong. Other people are assuming what I assumed: **Someone else is taking care of the problem.** That means no one is actually solving the problem.

> It’s easy to do nothing rather than something.

> It’s easy to think that guy over there is better because he’s in a suit.

> It’s easy to overestimate a man’s title.

It’s inaccurate and it’s an illusion.

**The individual who takes initiative is in the minority**. That’s the reality. He knows he’s vulnerable and he’s okay with it.

**No one is getting out of their car, amigo**. It’s an illusion and it prevents you from doing work that you assume someone else is already doing. Don’t overthink; take the first step and start instead.
