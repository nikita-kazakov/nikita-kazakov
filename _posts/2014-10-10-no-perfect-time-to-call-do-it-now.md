There is no perfect time to call someone. When you think about calling that person, **just call them and stop overthinking it**.

Ever think that it’s better to call in several days because that person _might_ be more available? How do you know what will happen in several days? What if that person is no longer available then or something terrible has happened? Don’t overthink and just call.

What if you wait to call in the evening and that person says NO or that they are not able to do what you wanted. You have just wasted your entire day waiting to call them at the ‘perfect time’. This advice alone will save you hours of time that are better used on your own productive mechanisms in life.

### Dude, you gotta wait 3 days bro…

This is the worst advice I’ve heard, but you’ve heard it too. You got a woman’s number, and a buddy that’s full of advice tells you ‘you gotta wait 3 days, or she’ll think you’re desperate’. Oh come on, you heard this one before. That’s called overthinking the situation. In 3 days, she’ll forget who you were.

She gave you her number. Go call her whenever you want to call her. When the opportunity pops into your mind, take action and call. DON’T OVERTHINK IT.

Mr. Twain knew about the magical monsters that plague our minds with illusions.
