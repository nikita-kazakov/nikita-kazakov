Bottom Line: There is no perfect time to call someone. When you think about calling that person, just call them and stop over thinking it.

I still mess this one up when calling friends. I'm not big on phone conversations.

I start to procrastinate and think that I should call in a couple of days. I tell myself that the person on the otherside will be more available then. It's bullshit.
 
How do I know what will happen in several days? 

What if that person won't be available or something terrible has happened? 

Don’t over think and just call.
