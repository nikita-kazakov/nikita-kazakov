Someone tells me “I promise I’ll…” When that promise is broken, I’ll feel let down. Trust points are shaved off. I would rather have that person not use the word promise and then I could attribute it to human error. I make mistakes too, so I’ll sympathize with a fellow human.

Let’s define promise from merriam-webster.com:

> A promise is a statement telling someone that you will **definitely** do something or that something will **definitely** happen in the future.

The word definitely is used twice in that definition, and represents a 100% guarantee. Can I offer 100% guarantee of anything in life? No. I can’t because life is in flux and always changing. Things happen, and certain events occur beyond my control. By promising, I’m only putting myself deeper into a deal that I might not be able to deliver on.

Why not just forgo using the word ‘promise’ and simply say what you intend to do and keep that intention. If you feel like there’s doubt as to whether you can deliver on it, say that. What’s a promise anyways? Does that translate to **your word \*Extra Strength\***? Your word should be good enough to convey integrity, which in this case is following through on what you said you’ll do.

Your word means a lot. If you’re a man of your word and come through with what you say, people will notice a trend in your character and actions.

An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises.
