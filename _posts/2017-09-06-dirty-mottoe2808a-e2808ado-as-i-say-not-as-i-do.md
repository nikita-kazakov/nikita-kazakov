Stacks of papers thrown across the table with plastic cups taking up the smallest of open space.

It was a piled mess.<figure>

Gym socks — sweat-yellowed beyond fresh — are on top of a barely standing pile of sweatshirts, jeans, and whatever else that was stacked in the corner of the room.

Have you heard of **_do as I say, not as I do_?** 

It’s a cop-out phrase for controlling strangers with rules you won’t abide by. _Some are more equal than others._

We stopped by to pick up a pool player and head down to shoot a couple of rounds with the guys.

He was chastising his 12-year-old boy because the kid’s room was cluttered.<figure>

The conversation was short-lived:

> “These clothes better be hung in the closet and soda cans picked off the floor.”

> “But there are cans on the floor in your room” said the kid.

> “Quiet. **Do as I say, not as I do.”**

Sincerity is words aligning with actions. Think of a person you admire. If you unwrap their layers, you’ll find sincerity is a major piece of the puzzle. It’s their ability to **_talk the talk and walk the walk._**

### When actions are out of sync with words

You get these common scenarios:

  * Personal trainer teaching you about strength while being out of shape.
  * A friend joining a multi-level marketing “business” trying to convince you that you TOO can be a millionaire.
  * A parent berating their kid for being overweight while being overweight themselves.
  * A smoking parent that tells their kid to stay away from cigarettes.
  * A short-tempered person giving you advice on managing anger through love.
  * A righteous follower quick to condemn your sins only to be publicly caught in those sins.

Next time you hear **_do as I do, not as I say — _**_don’t feel bad. Respond with_ **_walk the walk before talking the talk._**
