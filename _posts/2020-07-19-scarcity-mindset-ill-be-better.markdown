title:  "Scarcity Mindset - I'll still win."
excerpt: TLDR; Your stacked skills are more powerful than the sum of an individual skill. Also sharing is not a zero sum game.

Some folks fear sharing opportunities and knowledge with others because they think others will take something away from them. This is a scarcity mindset.

In reality, if you stack your skill, that shouldn’t bother you. I don’t fear sharing with you what I’ve learned or what school I went to or what job opportunity is available that I didn’t take. You know why? Because I’ve stacked certain skills (Scott Adams talks about this).

I might not be the smartest or the most technical guy for the job and you might be smarter than me, but you likely won’t have certain people skills, communication skills, and management skills I can bring to the table.

# Multiplier Effect

It’s the combination of skills that acts as a worth multiplier. This combination of skills is greater than the sum of the total technical skills alone. Therefore, I’m not worried.

Stack your skills. Add marketing, sales, tech, people skills, whatever to your skillset and you won’t have to live in fear of someone else taking your opportunities.
