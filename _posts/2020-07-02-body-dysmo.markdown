Before you start weight training, why are you doing it? Do you need to be a bodybuilder to get chicks? To get respect?

It’s easy to get lost and think you need to be a bodybuilder to change your life. You end up chasing gains and end up never satisfied. “I’m not deadlift 2x my body weight; I’m weak!”. That kind of attitude.

You end up going to the gym almost everyday even though you wish you didn’t have to.

You don’t need to do this.

Find out what your real reason for training is. For me, it was so that my butt looked good in pants. I had a flat butt before squats and deadlifts.

After a year passed, I saw changes in my wardrobe and not only did my butt look good in pants, my posture greatly improved and I could buy shirts that would accentuate my upper body. Period. Goal complete.

Unless bodybuilding is truly your calling, you don’t need to deadlift 400 lbs, or bench pressing at least 235lb to be satisfied.

A super muscular body isn’t going to get you laid. Not without stacking other skills with it (people skills, communication skills, empathy, hobbies).
