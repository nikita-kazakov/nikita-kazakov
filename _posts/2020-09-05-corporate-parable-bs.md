A turkey was chatting with a bull. 

"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy."

"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings? They're packed with nutrients." said the bull.

The turkey took a bite of the dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 

After eating some more dung on the next day, he reached the second branch. On the third day, he proudly reached the top of the tree.

A farmer spotted him, took aim with a rifle, and shot the turkey out of the tree.

**The moral of the story:** Bullshit might get you to the top --- but it won't keep you there.
