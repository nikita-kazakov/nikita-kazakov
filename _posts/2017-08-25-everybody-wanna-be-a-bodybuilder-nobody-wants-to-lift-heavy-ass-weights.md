When I heard Ronnie Coleman — an eight time Mr. Olympia Champion — utter these words, I was dumbfounded by the profoundness in one single sentence.

Ronnie Coleman is a powerhouse. He trains like a bodybuilder but lifts heavy as a powerlifter.

It’s easy to draw parallels between accomplishing things in life by looking at bodybuilding.

Here are lessons I picked up from Ronnie.

# Nobody wants to lift heavy ass weights

Ronnie is huge. He weighed damn near 300 lb at his bodybuilding competitions.<figure class="wp-caption">

> Everybody wanna be a bodybuilder — nobody wants to lift heavy ass weights — Ronnie Coleman

This phrase is crazy versatile. Apply it to anything you’re feeling strongly about. For example:

  * Everybody wanna be an entrepreneur, nobody wants to put in the work.
  * Everybody wanna be a ladies man, nobody wants to approach women.
  * Everybody wanna be big, nobody wants to eat more.
  * Everybody wanna be strong, nobody wants to go to the gym.
  * Everybody wanna be fit, nobody wants to consciously work their body.

# Ain’t nobody going to give you nothin’

In other words, don’t expect the tooth fairy to deliver the relationship, work, or health to you without some of your part in it.

> Ain’t nobody going to give you nothin’ — Ronnie Coleman

It’s too easy to sit on the floor or lie in bed and think _it will come…_

> And then one day you find ten years have got behind you  
> No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun — Time by Pink Floyd

Easy but not effective. Nothing happens until something moves.

# Yeah Buddy — Lightweight!

Watching Ronnie workout is not without lighthearted humor.

He’s about to lift a heavy steel dumbbell that’s made of nightmares but he’ll loudly say — Lightweight! or Yeah Buddy!

Ronnie keeps a lighthearted attitude before doing something difficult.

It’s one thing to crack jokes when looking down at the world from a pedestal, but a totally different manner when the world hits you up with a challenge.
