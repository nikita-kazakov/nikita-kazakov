Insightful definition of Mastery: “the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice.

If there is any sure route to success and fulfillment in life, it is to be found in the long-term, essentially goalless process of mastery.

There are three types of learners I found: the dabbler, the obsessive, and the hacker.

As with all significant learning, this learning was measured not in a straight line but **in stages**: brief spurts of progress separated by periods during which you seemed to be getting nowhere.

If you’re going to go for mastery, it’s better to start with a clean slate rather than have to unlearn bad habits.

The author gives an example with playing tennis. At first, you have to think to keep the parts of your body synchronized, and thinking gets in the way of graceful, spontaneous movement. Then, after about five weeks of frustration, a light goes on. The various components of the tennis stroke begin to come together, almost as if your muscles know what they should do; you don’t have to think about every little thing. 

I look at this as having a combination lock with three of the four digits dialed in. You have 75% of the lock solved but the lock doesn&#8217;t open. It feels like you did nothing. Until you have that last digit set, you won&#8217;t see the results of your labor.

Finally, you got some progress after 5 weeks with tennis and then days and weeks pass with no apparent progress. You hit the plateau.
