Within 2 years I gained 20 lbs of weight through weight training and specific diet strategies. My posture significantly improved and so did my confidence in my body.

I&#8217;ve tried to do this before but I just couldn&#8217;t keep the weight. This time was a success. Here&#8217;s what I did differently to succeed.

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="ruby" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;% flash.each do |type, msg| %>
  &lt;div>
    &lt;%= msg %>
  &lt;/div>
&lt;% end %>

def index
  @books = Book.all
  flash.now[:notice] = "We have exactly #{@books.size} books available."
end</pre>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def index
  @books = Book.all
  flash.now[:notice] = "We have exactly #{@books.size} books available."
end</pre>

I grew up tall and lean. I&#8217;m 6 foot and 3 inches tall. From my late teens until I turned 31, my weight hovered between 150 lb to 165lb.



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="ruby" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def say_hello
  puts "Hello!"
end

say_hello</pre>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="ruby" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def initialize(breed, name)  
    # Instance variables  
    @breed = breed  
    @name = name  
  end  
  
  def bark  
    puts 'Ruff! Ruff!'  
  end  
  
  def display  
    puts "I am of #{@breed} breed and my name is #{@name}"  
  end  
end  </pre>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="ruby" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def go
  1 + 1
end</pre>

I was self-conscious about my body image because I was an ectomorph. I could eat anything and yet my weight would stay about the same. My body would burn those calories without any thought. I didn&#8217;t have to think twice about food.

My friends who were endomorphs (can easily gain weight but mostly fat) were envious of me. However, all of us were truly envious of mesomorphs, those body types that easily gained muscle

I had good eating habits because Mom would make healthy home cooked food. I didn&#8217;t drink soda and stayed away from alcohol. 

I also worked consistently since middle school to today. I&#8217;ve done general calisthenics, P90X, gymnastics rings workouts, and weight training.
