Some dude is forcing his way into your lane. He&#8217;s about to skip all the poor bastards including yourself that waited in stop and go traffic. Screw him. Let him wait his turn. 

You&#8217;re thinking _I’m going to teach him. I&#8217;m going to punish his ass._

He pulls out a gun and suddenly the game changes. You&#8217;re no longer playing on your terms. [The emperor has no clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes) and unfortunately, you&#8217;re him.

I&#8217;m not even making this story up. That&#8217;s how this [driver signaled his right of way](https://youtu.be/_XG6zKQPlP8?t=16).<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I figured I&#8217;d share a few stories that personally taught me two things:

  * Be nice (most of the time)
  * Burning bridges will backfire

Here’s the problem: You might be right about teaching this arrogant bastard a lesson in the short term, but what guarantees will you have that you won’t cross paths in the near future?

Unless you’re a clairvoyant, you just don’t know.

Back in my university days, I was a teaching a petroleum lab experiment to groups of undergraduate students. Practically all of the undergraduate students treated each other with respect and common decency. &nbsp;They were there to learn, get a degree, and start a career.

There was one international student who wore arrogance like it was a veil wrapped around him at birth. At first you think it’s a cultural difference and no matter how nice you tried to be to him he’d treat you like a 2nd class citizen. He was there to get the grade wasn’t about to waste his breath on anyone else. This was consistent for the entire semester. &nbsp;It’s not hard to remember folks like this.

Fast forward two years and now I’m working in a consortium doing projects for petroleum companies. &nbsp;This guy just joined the same group I was part of. The group had other people in it that he’s treated like dirt in the past. Although his face wouldn’t fully show it, there was nervousness.

He tried very hard to be social and be part of this new circle. Unfortunately there’s a saying that it’s not what you do for people that they remember, it’s how you make them feel. &nbsp;That was a bitter lesson in burning your bridges and not expecting to walk on them in the future.

## Grudges in the Oil and Gas world

I’ve worked in the Oil and Gas software sector for about 7 years now. You’d be shocked at the grudges that are held from the past.

The Oil and Gas sector is tight and reputation seems to follow you. &nbsp;You move from one job to another through contacts.

So I go with my guys to give a sales tech demo to a mid-sized oil and gas company in the US. The demo goes well and the geologists feel our software will be great for their workflow and save them time they are wasting tinkering with Excel spreadsheets.

The company declines to buy. Why?

The VP of the company that has the final say is holding a grudge on the company that used to run our product 15 years ago. Someone from that company told him that he was an asshole. It wasn’t even our company that said it. &nbsp;However, we definitely felt the hit because we lost a big sale.

These types of grudges are more common than you think. You have to be careful as you never know who you’ll cross paths with in the future.

Realize that you don’t have to _teach_ anyone. I know the the itch for telling someone off in a heated moment and _teaching them_ a lesson. You’ll teach them and now you have to keep them in your head for a long time. Don’t take that responsibility. You have enough problems in life. Let it go and walk away. &nbsp;You’ll sleep better at night.
